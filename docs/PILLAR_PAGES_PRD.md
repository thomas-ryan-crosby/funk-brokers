# Pillar Detail Pages PRD

## Overview
Create three pillar detail pages that expand on the hero pillars. Each page should provide clear, confident copy and a focused set of sections that map to the core value of the pillar. These pages are the destination when a user clicks the corresponding pillar.

## Goals
- Deepen trust and understanding of OpenTo’s value at the earliest stage.
- Provide clear, structured explanations of features and outcomes per pillar.
- Drive users to explore or take the next step (browse, add property, or learn transactions).

## Non-Goals
- Full onboarding flows or account creation steps.
- Pricing or legal documentation.

## Audience
- Homeowners curious about early interest or quiet offers.
- Buyers exploring off-market or pre-listing opportunities.
- Real estate enthusiasts, neighbors, or second-home explorers.

## Pages and Copy

### 1) A space to share or browse — on your terms.
**Purpose:** Explain how anyone can claim a home, add data at their pace, and create a low-pressure way to explore or engage.

**Hero copy**
- Title: A space to share or browse — on your terms.
- Subtitle: A calm, flexible space to tell your home’s story early, explore quietly, and connect only when it feels right.

**Key sections**
1) **Claim and shape your home**
   - Copy: Claim your home and add as much or as little as you want. Upload photos, details, and updates over time — no pressure to “list,” no rush to decide.
2) **Quiet connections, real intent**
   - Copy: Start low-stakes conversations with neighbors, owners in other markets, or early buyers. Ask about vendors, learn a neighborhood, or explore a second home before the market does.
3) **Tell your story early**
   - Copy: Photos and notes give others a real feel for your home’s character — before a listing ever exists.
4) **You control visibility**
   - Copy: Choose what people can see and who can message you. Share openly, selectively, or not at all.
5) **Prepared for traction**
   - Copy: When interest appears, your home is already organized and positioned to move quickly — or attract meaningful offers at any time.

**Primary CTA**
- Add Property to Platform

**Secondary CTA**
- Browse Properties

### 2) A Centralized Home Hub
**Purpose:** Position OpenTo as the secure, single source of truth for documents, vendors, and property operations.

**Hero copy**
- Title: A Centralized Home Hub
- Subtitle: One secure place for your home’s key documents, vendors, and history — so nothing falls through the cracks.

**Key sections**
1) **All critical documents, organized**
   - Copy: Store warranties, permits, receipts, disclosures, and updates in one trusted place. No more digging through folders or spreadsheets.
2) **Trusted vendors, always ready**
   - Copy: Keep preferred vendors on hand for seasonal work or unexpected needs. Share access when someone else is managing the property.
3) **Confidence during transitions**
   - Copy: Going out of town? Handing the property off? Your records, contacts, and instructions are already organized and accessible.
4) **Preparedness is leverage**
   - Copy: A well-maintained, well-documented home builds confidence — for you, for caregivers, and for future buyers.

**Primary CTA**
- Add Property to Platform

**Secondary CTA**
- Explore How It Works

### 3) You Control the Transaction
**Purpose:** Explain the value of direct control, simpler process, and significant fee savings.

**Hero copy**
- Title: You Control the Transaction
- Subtitle: If you decide to buy or sell, you can do it directly — with a process that feels as easy as filing taxes online.

**Key sections**
1) **Direct control, real savings**
   - Copy: Save tens to hundreds of thousands in realtor fees by managing the process yourself when you’re ready.
2) **Clear, guided steps**
   - Copy: We give you a straightforward path with tools and guidance — without the pressure or gatekeeping.
3) **Choose who’s involved**
   - Copy: Bring in professionals when you want, not when you’re told to. You decide the pace and partners.
4) **Confidence before commitment**
   - Copy: Because your home and interest are already documented, you move faster when the moment is right.

**Primary CTA**
- See Buying and Selling Steps

**Secondary CTA**
- Browse Properties

## UX Requirements
- Each page should include:
  - Hero title and subtitle
  - 4–5 short sections with headings and 1–2 sentence descriptions
  - Clear primary and secondary CTAs
- Design should match existing landing page style: dark background, gradient accents, card-like sections.

## Navigation
- Clicking a hero pillar navigates to its corresponding page.
- Include a simple “Back to Home” link at the bottom of each page.

## Analytics (optional)
- Track CTA clicks per pillar page.
- Track time on page and section scroll depth.
